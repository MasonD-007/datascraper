## Data table Scraper
This is a chrome extension that allows you to scrape any data in a <table> tag and view it in a website viewer. 

## Why?
I was doing data entry and was doing a lot of repeated copying and pasting and I wanted a way to get more done in less time. So i tried to find an extension that would do this but I couldn't find any. So I decided to make my own.

1. go to chrome extension page
2. turn on developer mode
3. git clone the repo
4. click load unpacked
5. select the extension folder
6. go to the website you want to scrape
7. click the extension icon
8. click the scrape button
9. select the tables you want to scrape
10. click the scrape button
11. the data will be copied to your clipboard and it will be in its website viewer


## How to use the viewer

1. go to the website viewer
2. You can filter the data by clicking the filter input and typing the data you want to filter by
3. You can copy the data by clicking the copy button
4. You can delete the data by clicking the delete button
5. You can clear the data by clicking the clear button
